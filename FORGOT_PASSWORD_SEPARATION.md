# 🔐 Separated Forgot Password System

## 📋 Overview
Created two separate forgot password screens with role-based access control and proper navigation.

## 📱 Admin Forgot Password Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/admin/admin_forgot_password_screen.dart`

### ✅ Features:
- **Admin-Only Access**: Only users with 'admin' or 'administrator' role can reset passwords
- **Role Verification**: Checks staff_state collection for admin role
- **Professional UI**: Admin-themed design with admin panel icon
- **Secure Navigation**: Returns to admin login after successful reset
- **Clear Messaging**: Specific admin-focused messages and error handling

### 🎯 Validation Logic:
1. **Email Format Validation**: Ensures proper email format
2. **Collection Check**: Searches staff_state collection for email
3. **Role Verification**: Confirms user has admin privileges
4. **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase Auth for password reset
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for different scenarios

## 👮 Officer Forgot Password Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/forgot_password_screen.dart`

### ✅ Features:
- **Multi-Collection Support**: Checks both staff_state and user_requests
- **Admin Exclusion**: Redirects admin accounts to admin portal
- **Approval Verification**: Ensures user_requests accounts are approved
- **Officer-Themed UI**: Design focused on regular officers/users
- **Smart Navigation**: Returns to officer login after reset

### 🎯 Validation Logic:
1. **Email Format Validation**: Ensures proper email format
2. **Staff Collection Check**: Searches staff_state (excludes admins)
3. **User Collection Check**: Searches user_requests (approved only)
4. **Role-Based Routing**: Guides users to correct portal
5. **Approval Status**: Prevents unapproved users from resetting

## 🔄 Navigation Flow

### Admin Portal:
```
Admin Login → Forgot Password? → Admin Forgot Password → Success → Admin Login
```

### Officer Portal:
```
Officer Login → Forgot Password? → Officer Forgot Password → Success → Officer Login
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control:
- **Admin Screen**: Only admin role users
- **Officer Screen**: Non-admin staff + approved users
- **Cross-Portal Protection**: Prevents role mixing

### Data Validation:
- **Email Format**: Regex validation
- **Collection Existence**: Verifies account exists
- **Role Verification**: Confirms appropriate access level
- **Approval Status**: Checks user approval for user_requests

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Distinctions:
- **Admin Screen**: Admin panel icon, "Admin - Forgot Password" title
- **Officer Screen**: Person icon, "Officer - Forgot Password" title
- **Different Button Text**: "Send Admin Reset Email" vs "Send Officer Reset Email"

### Enhanced User Experience:
- **Clear Navigation**: Back buttons to respective login screens
