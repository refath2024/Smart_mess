# Dark Mode Text Visibility Fix - Smart Mess App

## Problem
The Flutter app had poor text visibility in dark mode across multiple screens. Text appeared dull and was difficult to read because the default dark theme colors were too dim. Specific issues identified:

1. **Meal IN screen**: Meal descriptions were barely visible
2. **Messing screen**: Table data had poor contrast
3. **Login screen**: Form labels and text were not visible at all
4. **Home screen**: Section titles and meal information were too dim
